*MRaster* is a very simple C++ library for generating raster images --
espeically things like fractals.

It is designed to be easy enough for beginners, but advanced enough
for experts.  It integrates well into existing code, uses pure C++20,
requires no external dependencies, and is quite fast.

*Version 20 Warning:*

Starting with v20, I'm refactoring the library.  I'm doing small
releases as functionality in a given area is complete.  The releases
are fully functional, but the API is still in flux.  I encourage you
to use v20, and provide feedback; however, don't put it in a
production system just yet. ;)
