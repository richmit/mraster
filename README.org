*MRaster* is a very simple C++ library for generating raster images --
espeically things like fractals.

It is designed to be easy enough for beginners, but advanced enough
for experts.  It integrates well into existing code, uses pure C++20,
requires no external dependencies, and is quite fast.

Some examples of what can be done with *MRaster*:

*Version 20 Warning:*

Starting with v20, I'm refactoring the library.  
  - The tagged commits are fully functional releases.
    - As of v20.7.0b, the refactor of the colorTpl template is complete
    - As of v20.8.0b, the refactor of the ramCanvasTpl template is complete (I think)
  - What's left
    - Some cleanup
    - Documentation
    - Testing
  - I encourage you to use v20, and provide feedback!
  - I do *not* encourage you to use it in production!
