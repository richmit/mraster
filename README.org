*MRaster* is a very simple C++ library for generating raster images --
espeically things like fractals.

It is designed to be easy enough for beginners, but advanced enough
for experts.  It integrates well into existing code, uses pure C++20,
has a minimum of external depeadancies, and is quite fast.

Some examples of what can be done with *MRaster*:
